# Bubble LED Clock

An 8-digit 7-segment "bubble" LED clock based on the ESP32. It features automatic NTP time synchronization, weather display from OpenWeatherMap, animated scenes, and a web-based configuration portal. This project serves as the primary, full-featured example application for the `ESP32NTPClock` library framework.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **8-Digit 7-Segment Display:** Utilizes a "bubble" LED display driven by an HT16K33 controller over I2C.
  * **Automatic Time Sync:** Connects to your WiFi and synchronizes its time with public NTP servers.
  * **Weather Display:** Fetches and displays the current temperature and humidity for a configured location from OpenWeatherMap. 
  * **Animated Scenes:** Cycles through displaying the time, date, and weather using a playlist of customizable animations (Slot Machine, Matrix, Scrolling). 
  * **Web Configuration:** On first boot or when WiFi fails, the clock enters an Access Point (AP) mode. You can connect to its WiFi network to configure all settings through a web page on your phone or computer.
  * **Double-Reset:** Manually enter the AP configuration mode at any time by quickly resetting the device twice. 
  * **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** Uses a DS1307 RTC module to keep time when offline and to enable the robust double-reset feature.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

1.  **First Boot:** On the very first boot, the clock will automatically start in Access Point (AP) mode. The display will show a message like "AP MODE...".
2.  **Connect to the AP:** Using your phone or computer, connect to the WiFi network named **`bubble-clock`**. [cite: 667]
3.  **Captive Portal:** Once connected, a configuration page should automatically open. If it doesn't, navigate to **`192.168.4.1`** in your web browser.
4.  **Enter Settings:** Fill in your WiFi SSID and password, your [POSIX timezone string](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/posix.tz.pl), and your OpenWeatherMap API key and location details.
5.  **Save:** Click "Save and Restart." The clock will reboot and connect to your WiFi network.

To re-enter configuration mode at any time, simply press the **reset button twice** in quick succession (about 1-2 seconds apart).
