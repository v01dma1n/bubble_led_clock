Of course. I've reviewed the latest source code with a focus on architecture and reusability.

You've already built a solid foundation with the `IGenericClock` interface and the separation of hardware drivers. To achieve your goal of creating new clock applications with minimal effort, the next step is to move more of the application's "engine"—the core operational logic—into the `ESP32NTPClock` library.

The guiding principle should be: **The library provides the *engine* (state machine, scene management, boot logic), while the application provides the *configuration* (the specific hardware, the list of scenes to display, and the data sources).**

Here is a list of recommended changes to achieve this.

---
## **1. Generalize the `SceneManager`**
The concept of cycling through a playlist of scenes (time, date, weather) is a generic clock feature. This entire manager should be moved into the library.

* **Action:**
    1.  [cite_start]Move the `DisplayScene` struct definition from `blc_types.h` into the library's `enc_types.h`. [cite: 27]
    2.  [cite_start]Move the `SceneManager` class (`blc_scene_manager.h` and `.cpp`) into the library. [cite: 104, 138]
    3.  Modify the library's `SceneManager::setup()` method to accept the scene playlist as an argument (e.g., `setup(const DisplayScene* playlist, int numScenes)`).
    4.  The application (`blc_app.cpp`) will then define its `scenePlaylist` array and pass it to the library's `SceneManager` during setup. This makes the *content* configurable while the *logic* is reusable.

* **Result:** The application is only responsible for defining a simple array of scenes. The complex logic for timing, transitions, and rendering is handled entirely by the library.

## **2. Decouple Data Fetching from Display Logic**
[cite_start]Currently, the `SceneManager::update()` method is responsible for calling the OpenWeatherMap API. [cite: 116] This tightly couples the display logic with a specific data source.

* **Action:**
    1.  Create a new `WeatherDataManager` or similar class within the **application**.
    2.  This new manager's `update()` loop will be responsible for checking timers and fetching new weather data when needed. [cite_start]When it gets data, it stores it in the `_currentWeatherData` struct. [cite: 117]
    3.  Remove all OpenWeatherMap API call logic from the library's `SceneManager`.
    4.  [cite_start]The `SceneManager` will continue to use the function pointers (like `BubbleLedClockApp_getTempData`) to get the latest value, but it will be completely unaware of *how* that data was fetched. [cite: 100, 101, 102]

* **Result:** The library's `SceneManager` becomes a pure display sequencer. A new clock application could be built without weather functionality simply by not providing weather-related scenes or a data-fetching manager.

---
## **3. Generalize the Double-Reset Boot Logic**
[cite_start]The logic in `BubbleLedClockApp::setup()` to detect a double-reset and enter AP mode is a fantastic, reusable feature for any IoT device. [cite: 43, 44] It should be in the library.

* **Action:**
    1.  Create a new utility function or a small class within the library (e.g., `BootManager`).
    2.  This utility will have a function like `bool checkForDoubleReset(RTC_DS1307& rtc, bool rtcActive)` that encapsulates the logic of using `Preferences` to store and check the last boot time.
    3.  The application's `setup()` function is then simplified to a single call: `if (BootManager::checkForDoubleReset(...)) { activateAccessPoint(); }`.

* **Result:** This common and tricky logic is abstracted away, making the application's setup code cleaner and more focused on its specific tasks.

---
## **4. Make the AP Mode Display Generic**
[cite_start]The `activateAccessPoint()` method in `blc_app.cpp` contains logic to display specific messages like "AP MODE..." and "CONNECTED...". [cite: 48, 50] This can be made more generic.

* **Action:**
    1.  Move the main loop of `activateAccessPoint()` into the `BaseAccessPointManager` class in the library.
    2.  The `BaseAccessPointManager` can take optional string parameters in its `setup()` for "waiting message" and "connected message".
    3.  The application then just calls a single `_apManager->runBlockingLoop(...)` method, which handles everything.

* **Result:** The application only needs to start the AP mode; the entire user-facing interaction during configuration is handled by the library.

By implementing these changes, your `ESP32NTPClock` library will become a powerful framework. A new application's source code would be dramatically smaller, primarily consisting of:
* A `main.ino` file.
* A custom `App` class that initializes hardware drivers.
* A `preferences.h` defining the configuration structure.
* A single `scenes.cpp` file that defines the display playlist.
